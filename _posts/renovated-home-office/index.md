I decided to renovate my Home Office.

The 4 traits I focused on:

1. increase comfort 💺
2. improve sound experience 🔊
3. look better during video calls 💅🏻
4. reduce distractions ❗

## This was the starting point.

![Starting point](../assets/blog/renovate-home-office/starting.jpeg)

A horizontal desk 160x60cm, an external monitor, keyboard and mouse. In this picture, you can see my old Surface 3 (I sold it) and my books and notebooks while studying for my degree.

## The cons

- The chair did not have lumbar support.
- I could not lay my arms on the desk while typing, because the desk was not large enough: the keyboard was too close to the desk border.
- The keyboard was an old (but good) apple Keyboard with a Mighty Mouse.
- 🔊 I had no external speakers nor microphone, so my day was always wearing in-ear headphones (a Sony pair which I really love [amzn.to/3pH7TwQ](https://amzn.to/3pH7TwQ) ).
- 💅🏻 I did have a lot of shadows and light coming from the left, making me not look good on the webcam.
- ❗The room was shared with my wife: her desk was on the opposite side of the room. but we had problems when we both attended meetings. Plus, we used that room as a closet so it was a bit messy.

## Start renovating

We have a very spacious house (lucky us) so I was able to use part of our basement to create a private Home Office. The room is 3.80 x 2.80 mt and I started sketching a possible furniture disposition.

The most important part I focused on was the desk.
I wanted a big corner desk with plenty of room to lay down my arms (45cm from desk border to keyboard) and the right distance to my monitors (60-70cm ready to migrate to a big curved one).

I wanted a library where I can show my Final Fantasy, Kingdom hearts and One Piece collections: manga, video games and action figures so I can turn off any background filter during video calls and anyone can get a glimpse of my passions. 🏯

I wanted to create an atmosphere where the white, wooden and green colors can mix and match to give me a relaxed, bright environment.

So I bought some SPC floor to easily install on top of the existing one: their click mechanism allowed me and my wife to do it on our own.

I looked on different second-hand sites and found my desk, wardrobe and library! There was a lot of fun renting a van with my wife and going to get all of them 🚚 ![Desk](../assets/blog/renovate-home-office/desk.jpeg)

## New purchases

First of all, I bought a gaming chair.
After countless reviews and going through stores, I found the best for my needs in a GT Player chair: [amzn.to/34mU53m](https://amzn.to/34mU53m)

Then, I wanted a portable mechanical keyboard with a numeric pad. I always spied on Keychron and in the end I bought a K4: [amzn.to/3sWJVQB](https://amzn.to/3sWJVQB)

I wanted a new mouse too, an ergonomic wireless one like the Anker I bought: [amzn.to/3vL5nK6](https://amzn.to/3vL5nK6)

I bought a transparent carpet to put under the chair in order to protect the new floor from the chair wheels: [amzn.to/3tCu0pC](https://amzn.to/3tCu0pC)

I already have a desk lamp I use to enlighten my face during video calls, here is the link: [amzn.to/3vJx7P7](https://amzn.to/3vJx7P7)

I bought 3 small plants: aloe vera, Ficus Benjamin and Lucky bamboo. They should help keep the air quality good. ![Plants](../assets/blog/renovate-home-office/plants.jpeg)

Regarding lightning: for offices, it is advised to have 300-400 Lux per square meter. Simple math 400x11 = 4400 Lumen needed. I bought a lamp holder [amzn](https://amzn.to/3Cm01Gn).to/3Cm01Gn](https://amzn.to/3Cm01Gn) with 6 LED bulbs 800 Lumen each [amzn.to/3IKPCX4](https://amzn.to/3IKPCX4)
I chose a warm light as I find it more relaxing. ![Light](../assets/blog/renovate-home-office/light.jpeg)

This is a bit of what the office looks like right now 😁

## Still missing

1. a microphone that makes me sound like a rock star 🧑🏻‍🎤🎙️
2. external speakers that make my in-ear headphones not needed at all 🎶
3. a fixed external webcam with higher definition 📸
4. sound absorbing panels
5. a big wide curved monitor (I think 1 big monitor may be superior to the 2 monitors setup)
6. probably, an air conditioner as I think summer may be really hot
7. a beautiful organizer like [amzn.to/372JWcV](https://amzn.to/372JWcV)
8. some paintings
