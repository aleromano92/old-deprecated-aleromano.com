## Coaching Helps You Develop a Safe Continuous Feedback Culture ♾️

If the culture of your company is not conducive to open communication, then you could be missing out on one of the biggest benefits of a coaching relationship—namely, more frequent and consistent opportunities to give and receive feedback.

Employees would prefer to receive critical **feedback in person** rather than via an impersonal email.
The sort of healthy, two-way communication that occurs during one-to-ones is likely to be far more conducive to **employee retention** than the sort of hierarchical communication that often happens over email.

Being able to give and receive feedback on the job is important since all employees make mistakes. And yet a lot of workers said they have never received any critical feedback at work, or worse, they said they fear receiving feedback so much, that they have avoided asking for it altogether.

By getting coaching, you can ensure that feedback is happening in a safe, constructive way that is beneficial for both the person giving it and the person receiving it.

## Coaching Helps You Foster Employee Growth 🚀

As a coach, you can provide training, support and guidance to employees who may be struggling with their careers.

The more closely you can observe and understand the employee’s needs and goals, the better you can help them achieve their objectives.
You can also help employees gain confidence in themselves as well. The more confident an employee feels about his or her work history, the more likely he or she is to feel like he or she is making progress and becoming a better person.

A coach will also be able to provide helpful **feedback that helps employees build on their strengths and grow as individuals**. These feedback sessions should include providing advice on how to improve a particular skill (e.g., communication, refactoring, testing) or identifying areas to develop to be promoted (e.g., understanding budget concepts).

## Coaching Helps You Improve your Emotional Intelligence 🧘

Having one-to-one sessions is extremely beneficial for the coachee, but they have a high return on the coach as well.

Coaching requires you to have deep **emotional awareness**, be attentive to others, ask questions and actively listen, and have curiosity about others. All of these skills go towards improving your emotional intelligence. The more you put these skills into use, the stronger they get, and the better your coaching gets too.

You’ll get better at reading people, handling sticky situations, and helping others. You’ll become more confident in your abilities and feel more comfortable working with others.

You must be patient and have a desire to help others. You’ll also have to have some knowledge about the topic you’re coaching.

## Conclusion 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

During these meetings, you will come across many different personalities, each with their quirks and ways of thinking. By actively listening to your coachee and asking the right questions, you will be able to improve your emotional intelligence which leads to a **more meaningful career**.

> DAJE!
